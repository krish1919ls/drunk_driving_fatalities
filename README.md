# How do drunk driving laws affect traffic deaths?
The project investigates the importance of beer tax and other state laws on annual motor vehicle fatality rates between 1982 and 1988. Effects of prevailing economic conditions and demographic factors are also considered in the panel data regression models to understand the true effects.<br/>
## About Data
US traffic fatalities panel data are for the “lower 48” US states (i.e., excluding Alaska and Hawaii), annually for 1982 through 1988. Traffic fatality data were obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation Fatal Accident Reporting System. Total vehicle miles traveled annually by state was obtained from the Department of Transportation.  Personal income was obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the unemployment rate was obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br/>
